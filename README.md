🚶‍♂️ Custom Walkspeed & Stamina Control (RedM)
Description
This client-side Lua script for RedM (Cfx.re based) gives players full control over their character's walk speed and introduces a custom, dynamic stamina drain and recharge system using native RDR2 functions.

The script resolves the mismatch between movement speed and stamina depletion, allowing for precise configuration of server RP mechanics. 
(ONLY RSG CORE BASED)
Feature,Description
Speed Switching "Players can cycle through multiple preset walk/run speeds (e.g., 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.7, 2.1)."
Custom Drain (1.7) "At speed 1.7 (Jog), stamina depletion is set to a 1.5 multiplier (half the max drain), simulating moderate exertion."
Max Drain (2.1) "At speed 2.1 (Sprint), stamina depletion is set to a 3.0 multiplier, simulating high energy expenditure."
Accelerated Recharge,Stamina regenerates faster than default while walking slowly or idle (recharge multiplier 2.0).
Hotkeys,Speed is controlled via hotkeys (default: UP Arrow and DOWN Arrow).
Chat Command,A /walkspeed command is available to check or set the speed directly.
